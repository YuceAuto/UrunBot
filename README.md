Below is a conceptual example of how you might structure a Python application that connects three different custom GPT models (“FabiaBot”, “ScalaBot”, and “KamiqBot”) and exposes them behind a single chat interface. The key ideas are:

1. **A single REST API** (using a framework like FastAPI or Flask) that your frontend can call.  
2. **Logic in the backend** to decide which bots should respond to the query.  
3. **A comparison mode** that, when triggered, queries multiple bots and compares/contrasts their responses.

This example uses **FastAPI** for illustration, but the same idea can be easily adapted to **Flask** or other frameworks. The “custom GPT” endpoints could be local functions, external URLs, or calls to the OpenAI API configured with different prompts/models. Adjust the code to fit your actual environment.

## High-Level Architecture

```
 ┌──────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐ 
 │    Frontend   │ --->  │ FastAPI/Flask│  --\
 │  (React/Vue)  │ <---  │   Backend    │  <--+---> FabiaBot
 └──────────────┘       └─────────────┘  <--+---> ScalaBot
                                           \---> KamiqBot
```

1. **Frontend**: A single-page application (SPA) with a chat-like interface that sends user messages to the backend via an API endpoint.
2. **Backend**: A Python server application that receives the user query, applies the logic to determine which bots to call, then consolidates the response(s) into a single JSON response.
3. **Bots**: Three different endpoints or functions for FabiaBot, ScalaBot, and KamiqBot. They may be:
   - Three separate OpenAI completions or chat endpoints with different system prompts.
   - Three custom models on a local or remote inference server.
   - Any other structure as long as each is called independently and returns a text response.

## Example Directory Structure

```
my_app/
├─ main.py            # FastAPI/Flask entry point
├─ bots/
│   ├─ fabiabot.py    # Code/functions for calling FabiaBot
│   ├─ scalabot.py    # Code/functions for calling ScalaBot
│   └─ kamiqbot.py    # Code/functions for calling KamiqBot
├─ logic/
│   └─ decision.py    # Code for deciding which bot(s) to invoke
└─ requirements.txt   
```

This structure is optional but helps keep things organized.

---

## Example `bots/fabiabot.py`

```python
# bots/fabiabot.py

import requests

# Example function to call FabiaBot (could be local or external)
def get_fabia_answer(prompt: str) -> str:
    """
    Call your custom endpoint / model for FabiaBot here.
    For demonstration, we'll just pretend we do an HTTP request.
    Adjust this to your actual environment.
    """
    # Example: If you have an endpoint: POST /fabiabot/complete
    # response = requests.post("https://api.fabiabot.com/complete", json={"prompt": prompt})
    # return response.json().get("answer")

    # Temporary placeholder for demonstration
    return f"FabiaBot says: I received the prompt '{prompt}'."
```

Similarly, create `scalabot.py` and `kamiqbot.py` in the same fashion.

---

## Example `logic/decision.py`

```python
# logic/decision.py

from typing import List

def should_compare(prompt: str) -> bool:
    """
    Simple function to decide if we need a 'comparing question' mode.
    In real usage, you might parse the prompt or use an NLP classifier
    to decide if the user is asking for differences or comparisons.
    """
    keywords = ["compare", "difference", "which is better", "contrast", "vs"]
    prompt_lower = prompt.lower()
    return any(keyword in prompt_lower for keyword in keywords)

def decide_which_bots(prompt: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Decide which bot(s) should handle the user's query.
    For demonstration, let's say:
      - If the user mentions "fabia", we choose FabiaBot.
      - If the user mentions "scala", we choose ScalaBot.
      - If the user mentions "kamiq", we choose KamiqBot.
      - Otherwise, choose them all.
    Adjust this logic to your real needs.
    """
    prompt_lower = prompt.lower()

    selected_bots = []
    if "fabia" in prompt_lower:
        selected_bots.append("fabia")
    if "scala" in prompt_lower:
        selected_bots.append("scala")
    if "kamiq" in prompt_lower:
        selected_bots.append("kamiq")

    if not selected_bots:
        # If no specific mention, let's default to all
        selected_bots = ["fabia", "scala", "kamiq"]

    return selected_bots
```

## Example `main.py` (FastAPI)

```python
# main.py

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

# Import the logic and the bot access functions
from bots.fabiabot import get_fabia_answer
from bots.scalabot import get_scala_answer  # you'll define similarly
from bots.kamiqbot import get_kamiq_answer  # you'll define similarly
from logic.decision import should_compare, decide_which_bots

app = FastAPI()

class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str

class ChatResponse(BaseModel):
    combined_answer: str
    bot_responses: dict

@app.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat_endpoint(request: ChatRequest):
    user_prompt = request.prompt

    # 1. Decide which bots to invoke
    bots_to_invoke = decide_which_bots(user_prompt)

    # 2. Check if we need comparison
    comparison_mode = should_compare(user_prompt)

    # 3. Collect responses
    bot_responses = {}
    for bot_name in bots_to_invoke:
        if bot_name == "fabia":
            bot_responses["FabiaBot"] = get_fabia_answer(user_prompt)
        elif bot_name == "scala":
            bot_responses["ScalaBot"] = get_scala_answer(user_prompt)
        elif bot_name == "kamiq":
            bot_responses["KamiqBot"] = get_kamiq_answer(user_prompt)

    # 4. Combine or compare the responses
    if comparison_mode and len(bot_responses) > 1:
        # Example approach: Summarize differences
        # In practice, you might feed the responses into another LLM
        # that produces a structured comparison. For now, let's just
        # do a naive string with each response labeled.
        combined = "Comparing answers:\n\n"
        for name, resp in bot_responses.items():
            combined += f"{name}: {resp}\n"
        # Possibly add a final comparison statement here
        combined += "\n(End of comparison.)"
    else:
        # If not in comparison mode or there's only one bot,
        # we can just return the single (or first) response
        # or merge them in a simpler way.
        combined = " | ".join(bot_responses.values())

    return ChatResponse(combined_answer=combined, bot_responses=bot_responses)
```

### Notes on the Example
- `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse` are **Pydantic** models for request/response validation in FastAPI.  
- `decide_which_bots()` is a placeholder. Replace it with your business logic or an NLP-based approach.  
- `should_compare()` is a placeholder function that checks a few keywords to guess if the user wants a comparison. Use your own logic or a classifier.  
- If you have different ways of calling each bot (e.g., one is an external API, one is an internal function), adapt the code in the loop.

---

## Frontend (Simplified Concept)

Your frontend (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) would have a chat interface that calls your FastAPI endpoint:

```js
// Pseudocode for a React component

function Chat() {
  const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState("");
  const [response, setResponse] = useState("");

  async function sendMessage() {
    const res = await fetch("/chat", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: userInput }),
    });
    const data = await res.json();
    setResponse(data.combined_answer);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <textarea 
        value={userInput}
        onChange={e => setUserInput(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type your question..."
      />
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>

      <div>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <p>{response}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Chat;
```

Of course, you’d expand this to handle a more typical “chat” interface with messages in a conversation list, display each bot’s name, and so forth.

---

## Summary

1. **Backend**: 
   - Use a web framework (FastAPI/Flask).  
   - Create an endpoint (`POST /chat`).  
   - Decide which bot(s) to call based on your logic.  
   - Call each bot with the user’s prompt.  
   - If the request requires a comparative answer, present the differences in the combined response. Otherwise, pick or merge the answer from one (or all) bots.

2. **Frontend**:
   - A single chat-like UI that calls your backend endpoint with the user’s prompt.  
   - Displays the combined (or comparative) result from your backend.
